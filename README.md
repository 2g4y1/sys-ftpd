# sys-ftpd

This is a nintendo-switch sysmodule which runs an ftpd-server in the background (on port 5000 with no auth).

Right now the switch freezes on sleep but other than that it seems to run pretty great.

The ftpd is basically copy paste from [this](https://github.com/DavidBuchanan314/ftpd) ftpd-fork.
