# sys-ftpd

This is a nintendo-switch sysmodule which runs an ftpd-server in the background (on port 5000 with no auth).

Right now the server stops listening on sleep but other then that it works pretty great.

The ftpd is basically copy paste from [this](https://github.com/DavidBuchanan314/ftpd) ftpd-fork.
